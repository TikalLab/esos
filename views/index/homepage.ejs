					<h4>You went open source</h4>
					<p>
            You may have started it from scratch, or you may have open sourced some proprietary work you’ve done. You wanted to give back to the community, to gain recognition, maybe just to get some feedback. You published an open source project. Next thing you know, you have users. Sometimes tens, hundreds and maybe even thousands of them.

					<h4>Your users rely on you</h4>
					<p>
						Your users love what you did. They use it, and they come to rely on it. Sometimes they have problems and they ask for your help. Sometimes they go as far as to solve their problems and they send you pull requests so you can integrate it with your core project.

					<h4>Work piles up</h4>
					<p>
						Suddenly your project becomes a burden. You can’t commit to it because you do it voluntarily, and on the other hand you get pressure from your users as if you were a commercial provider. Someone will suffer - Either you, your users, or you may even decide to quit the project altogether.

					<h4><%=config.get('app.name')%> to the rescue</h4>
					<p>
						This is where <%=config.get('app.name')%> fits in. We fill the gap between your limited resources and your user's expectations. We create an infrastructure for you to commit to support your users when they need it, and for them to support you financialy for being there for them. It’s a great deal where everybody becomes happy.
